        <strong><em>Disclaimer: The Ember community is already making a
        monumentous effort to improve on all the points I'm addressing in this
        post.</em></strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        All things Ember move really fast. Even though I consider myself an
        expert with Ember, I have to confess that I also have trouble to keep up
        with the rapid pace that Ember changes in.

      <h2>A little backstory</h2>

      <p>
        I work with a small team of developers on a few Ember apps. One of them,
        that has not hit production, is being developed using the canary branch
        of Ember. Two others are, after some good effort on working away
        deprecations, on 1.13.x. Another one that is not actively developed
        anymore, because the new canary app will replace it, is on 1.12. The
        last app we aren't able to  upgrade to 1.13.x, because we used private
        api that is no longer in 1.13 because of the introduction of Glimmer, it
        would take a lot of effort to refactor out the mistake we made.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our story doesn't even sound so bad, there are many companies that are
        still stuck at 1.12 or 1.11. I even heard of a company that still had to
        port their app from using globals to Ember CLI. We could probably
        upgrade our 1.13.x apps to 2.0 within ample days of the release.
      </p>

      <h2>It's all about keeping up</h2>

      <p>
        The first step to keeping up with Ember's rapid changes is learning what
        will change, but that is not enough, after you know what changes, you
        will have to learn why it will change and what you have to do to make
        those changes. This can sometimes prove to be very difficult.
      </p>

      <h3>Finding out what will change and how to change it</h3>

      <p>
        How do I learn what will change, and how and when to make those changes?
        By spending a (halve) hour a day on discovering what has happened.
      </p>

      <p>
        My primary source is Twitter. A lot of prominent Ember developers are on
        Twitter, so following them provides a steady stream of new knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another good source is Slack, Ember has it's own Slack community. You
        will learn about the various problems everyone has by just reading the
        backlog on various active channels. An added bonus of chat is that you
        can even ask questions yourself and mostly get an useful answer within
        an hour or so.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is also the official <a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/">blog</a>,
        <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/">guides</a> and the
        <a href="http://emberjs.com/deprecations/v1.x/">deprecations</a> page,
        but a lot of things (sadly) go undocumented, are just barely documented
        or are documented later than it could have been.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also started watching <a href="http://reddit.com/r/emberjs">/r/emberjs</a>
        recently, there can sometimes be things on there that I've missed on the
        other sources.
      </p>

      <h3>Keep up now, not later</h3>

      <p>
        As soon as I know that change will be needed in the future, I will try
        to deal with it right away. For example: when it was
        <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/15">announced in november
        2014</a> that components would be the way forward for Ember, we started
        to move refactor our controllers into components.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unless you decide to not upgrade, it is inevitable that you will have to
        make changes. I think it's best not to delay this, delaying would only
        make it worse, as that would probably increase the amount of effort
        needed to make the change.

      <h2>Keeping up battles</h2>

      <h3>Ember 2.0</h3>

      <p>
        The easiest one for me now is keeping up with the newly added
        deprecations in the 1.13.x patch series. Once you are up to the point
        that all views and controllers have been refactored into components,
        then it's just small mechanical changes. For example: computed
        property keys that end in <code>@each</code> should be changed to end
        on <code>[]</code>.
      </p>

      <h3>Glimmer</h3>

      <p>
        Glimmer introduces virtual dom, lifecycle hooks and more. The virtual
        dom part isn't that hard to deal with, because mostly you don't, you
        only have to add some keys to your <code>{{each}}</code> blocks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dealing with the new lifecycle hooks is a little bit hard, I think that
        I still don't fully get how to unlock the great potential that is there.
        When do I use them? How do I use them? The
        <a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2015/06/12/ember-1-13-0-released.html#toc_component-lifecycle-hooks">
        blog post</a> that introduces them is just little more then an
        enumeration of which lifecycle hook there are.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Down, Action Up</h3>

      <p>
        Dealing with DDAU will probably the hardest battle after getting rid of
        views and controllers. It is much talked about, but never really fully
        thoroughly explained. Stefan Penner's
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvZEddrClAQ">talk about
        observers</a> does explain it a little bit.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 1.13 blog post mentions that the new Glimmer lifecycle hooks enable
        you to write DDAU components, but does not mention how.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Just a Glimmer in the dark</h2>

      <p>
        I am afraid that I don't fully grasp the upcoming idioms like the
        lifecycle hooks and DDAU. That because I don't fully understand it I run
        the risk of doing it wrong and having to repair it later. That fear is
        increased with the fresh 2.0 app we are building.
      </p>

      <h3>Let's light it up</h3>

      <p>
        It would be super awesome if it would be much more easier to upgrade.
        I'm going to make it a mission to get something up there that will
        explain how to prepare your 1.13 / 2.0 apps for the upcoming DDAU flow
        in 2.1.
      </p>

      <p>
        If anyone reading this has an idea how to deal with lifecycle hooks and
        DDAU then please share it. In the mean time I'll do my bestest to learn
        how and then to write it up in words.
